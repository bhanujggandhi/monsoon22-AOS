In this assignment, our task was to implement the system calls in the Linux kernel and test them out by compiling the kernel.

# Steps Followed

1. Download the compressed file of *Linux Kernel version 4.19.210*.
2. Extract the downloaded kernel file in */usr/src*.

```bash
    $ sudo tar -xvf linux-4.19.210.tar.xz -C/usr/src
```

1. Go to the extracted folder
2. Implement System Calls
    1. **Question 1. : Write syscall to print a welcome message to Linux logs**
        1. Create a Folder for a new system-call *`hello`*
        2. Create a C file inside it. `*hello.c*`
        3. Implement the system call as shown in `*bhanujhello.c*`
            
            ![Untitled](Assignment%202%20Adding%20and%20testing%20a%20new%20system%20call%20%2055f937de275b4b4f986420543e54d3ed/Untitled%201.png)
            
        4. Create a make file in the `*hello*` folder named `*Makefile`* and include the following line:
            
            `obj-y := hello.o`
            
        5. Add function call definition in `*./include/syscall.h*` header file.
        `asmlinkage long sys_bhanujhello(void);`
        6. Add the system call entry in `*syscalls_32.tbl*`
            
            <aside>
            ðŸ’¡ The format for syscalls_32.tbl is:
            
            `<number> <abi> <name> <entry point> <compat entry point>`
            
            *(As described in syscalls_32.tbl file itself)*
            
            For 32-bit intel systems, abi is i386
            
            `387    i386    hello    sys_bhanujhello`
            
            </aside>
            
        7. Add folder name to `*Makefile*` of kernel
        `core-y += kernel/ certs/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ hello/`
        
        <aside>
        ðŸ’¡ *Step iv*: During the kernel recompilation, this Makefile describes the items that must be built and added to the source code.
        
        *Step vii:* This will inform the compiler that we also need to build the files in the directory hello/.
        
        Therefore, the process would go as follows: after running the root makefile, which now lists the hello/ directory, it will look for another makefile in that directory for additional guidance on which objects to build.
        
        </aside>
        
    2. **Question 2.: Write syscall which will receive string parameter and print it along with some message to kernel logs**
        1. Create a Folder for a new system-call `*bhanujprint*`
        2. Create a C file inside it. `bhanujprint*.c*`
        3. Implement the system call as shown in `*bhanujprint.c*`
            
            ![Untitled](Assignment%202%20Adding%20and%20testing%20a%20new%20system%20call%20%2055f937de275b4b4f986420543e54d3ed/Untitled%202.png)
            
        4. Create a make file in the `bhanujprint` folder named `*Makefile`* and include the following line:
            
            `obj-y := bhanujprint.o`
            
        5. Add the system call entry in *`syscalls_32.tbl`*
        6. Add folder name to `*Makefile*` of kernel
            
            `core-y += kernel/ certs/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ hello/ bhanujprint/`
            
    3. **Question 3.: Write system call to print the parent process id and current process id upon calling it**
        1. Create a Folder for a new system-call `bhanujprocess`
        2. Create a C file inside it. `bhanujprocess.c`
        3. Implement the system call as shown in `bhanujprocess.c`
            
            ![Untitled](Assignment%202%20Adding%20and%20testing%20a%20new%20system%20call%20%2055f937de275b4b4f986420543e54d3ed/Untitled%203.png)
            
        4. Create a make file in the `bhanujprocess` folder named `Makefile`and include the following line:
            
            `obj-y := bhanujprocess.o`
            
        5. Add function call definition in `./include/syscall.h` header file.
        `asmlinkage long sys_bhanujprocess(void);`
        6. Add the system call entry in `*syscalls_32.tbl*`
            
            <aside>
            ðŸ’¡ The format for syscalls_32.tbl is:
            
            `<number> <abi> <name> <entry point> <compat entry point>`
            
            *(As described in syscalls_32.tbl file itself)*
            
            For 32-bit intel systems, abi is i386
            
            `387    i386    hello    sys_bhanujprint _ia32_sys_bhanujprint`
            
            where ia32_sys_#syscallname is a wrapper to a function that helps the system call to parse the arguments passed. As in this system call, we need to pass an argument we have to specify the `compat entry point` also.
            
            </aside>
            
        7. Add folder name to `Makefile` of kernel
        `core-y += kernel/ certs/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ hello/ bhanujprint/ bhanujprocess/`
    4. **Question 4: Write system call to execute some predefined system call from your written system call**
        
        *In this question, I have implemented `getppid()` function call which is named as `bhanujgetppid()` which will return parent processâ€™ process id(pid).* 
        
        1. Create a Folder for a new system-call `*bhanujgetppid*`
        2. Create a C file inside it. `*bhanujgetppid.c*`
        3. Implement the system call as shown in `bhanujgetppid.c`
            
            ![Untitled](Assignment%202%20Adding%20and%20testing%20a%20new%20system%20call%20%2055f937de275b4b4f986420543e54d3ed/Untitled%204.png)
            
        4. Create a make file in the `bhanujgetppid` folder named `Makefile`and include the following line:
            
            `obj-y := bhanujgetppid.o`
            
        5. Add function call definition in `./include/syscall.h` header file.
        `asmlinkage long sys_bhanujgetppid(void);`
        6. Add the system call entry in `*syscalls_32.tbl*`
        7. Add folder name to `Makefile` of kernel
        `core-y += kernel/ certs/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ hello/ bhanujprint/ bhanujprocess/ bhanujgetppid/`   
        
        <aside>
        ðŸ’¡ Final `*syscalls_32.tbl*` file will look like:

3.  Compile the Kernel

```bash
# Makefile for menuconfig
$ sudo make menuconfig

# Compiling kernel and kernel modules
$ sudo make -j 4 && sudo make modules_install -j 4

# Installing kernel
$ sudo make install -j 4

# *Where -j n defines the number of cores to be given to the process
# that will run this command*

# This is to update the kernel entries in the grub
$ sudo update-grub
$ sudo shutdown now -r

```

> **Q) Are both process IDs the same or different? Why? What are your observations?**
> 
> 
> No current process ID and parent process ID are not the same, as they both are different. Shell we are in right now will execute a process by executing the instance of *a.out* binary. The process of *a.out* binary will be the child process of the current shell process. Parent ID will be the process ID of the shell and current process ID will be the instance of *a.out* process ID.
> 
> The process ID is a unique ID, thus it won't correspond to any running processes.
> 
> The child process inherits some attributes like *Time Limit, Region Size*, *current working directory*, etc.
